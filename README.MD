# Joe's proposed plan:

## Preparation:
 - Pratyaksh: Look at Linear optimisation, integer optimisation, constraint optimisation, assignment, scheduling in OR tools
 - Joseph: look at: routing, bin packing, network flows in OR tools
 - Isaac: Make sure you generlly know python, and have a look at this book: https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf (perhaps we might need to select some sections that are the most important bc its quite long)
 - Anyone who can be bothered: start writing (or finding libs for) stock code that does the algorithms in Isaac's book. Might also be nice to make some stock file handling code that we can paste in, although that will only save max 2 mins. Also, making a grid search function that takes in a greedy method and tries it with a bunch of different aprameters and selects the best would be useful.
 
Timelime:

10 mins to read question

15 mins to discuss to make sure we all get it and to thing a bit about possible solutions

3 hr coding:
 - Isaac: work on file handling and then either randomised greedy, or monte carlo (1.5hr); write metaheuristics (1.5hr)
 - Pratyakhs and Joe: discuss whether can use OR tools. If so whoever covered the right function does it and the other one does a solution like one we would do from com soc (level 4). Otherwise both do separate level 4 solutions
